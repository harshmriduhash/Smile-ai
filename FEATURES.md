## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Smile AI now includes a powerful RAG system that enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant code from your codebase:

- **Context-Aware Responses**: The AI model receives relevant code snippets based on your query, allowing it to provide more accurate and contextual answers.
- **Local Knowledge Base**: Your codebase is automatically indexed and used as a knowledge base for the AI model.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the similarity threshold, context size, and other parameters to fine-tune the RAG system.
- **Smart Retrieval**: Only the most relevant code snippets are included in the context, optimizing token usage.
- **Enhanced Codebase Understanding**: The AI can reference implementation details, architectural patterns, and coding conventions from your codebase.

Enable or disable RAG in the extension settings, and configure how much context is included with each query.
